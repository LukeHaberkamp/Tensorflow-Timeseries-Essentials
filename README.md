# Tensorflow-Timeseries-Essentials

These scripts show how to implement LSTM variants to accomplish a variety of basic sequencing modeling tasks.  
This is less focused on the actual models, but instead aimed at demonstrating the basic preprocessing involved.  

The scripts included are:  
* A-NextValuePrediction.ipynb : Demonstrates how to perform next value time-series forecasting  
* B-MultiStepForecast.ipynb : Implements multi-step time-series forecasting  
* C-Denoising.ipynb : Removes gaussian noise from a time-series  
* D-Classification.ipynb : Classifies time-series data generated with the logistic growth equation as either stable or unstable
